Webd uses the GET/POST method to serve static content
(text, HTML, GIF, and JPG ....files) out of ./ and to serve dynamic
content by running CGI programs out of ./cgi-bin.

webd provides following functions:
1.provide GET/POST method to view static content and run cgi script
2.provide HTTP and HTTPS connection
3.provide dircetory view function
4.provide some access control based by ip address
5.provide easy logging function

To run Webd:
   Run "webd" on the server machine, 
	e.g., "webd"
	Maybe you should type "./webd" if current directory is not in your $PATH

   There are several argument option:
   -d  --daemon        -> webd run in the background  
   -p  --port          -> assigned http port
   -s  --sslport       -> assigned https port
   -l  --log           -> assigned log path
   -e  --extent        -> provide https function 
   -h  --help          -> help  
   -v  --version       -> some other informations  


   So,you can also do this:
   	webd -d -p 8888 -s 4444 -e 

   If your port is less then 1024,you must have the root permission,or use the sudo command.


   Point your browser at webd: for example,http port is 8888,and https port is 4444
   you can view following page:
   	http:
	    127.0.0.1:8000       home page

	    127.0.0.1:8000/dir   view dir 
	         -> you can point the file name to view file contents
	            or point the directory name to view the directory content

	    127.0.0.1:8888/getAuth.html    
	         -> a GET method page,login with email and password,
		    you will see you email and password content 

	    127.0.0.1:8888/postAuth.html    
	         -> a POST  method page,login with email and password, 
		    you will see you email and password content

	https: the same function as to http,just uri has a litter changes
	    https://127.0.0.1:4444       
	    https://127.0.0.1:4444/dir       
	    https://127.0.0.1:4444/getAuth.html       
	    https://127.0.0.1:4444/postAuth.html       

Files:
	cert.pem                 ->  the https CA,use openssl to create,
	                             so you must accept the CA to continue 
	cgi-bin                  ->  cgi script directory
	        getAuth.c        ->  the get method cgi script
	        postAuth.c       ->  the post method cgi script
		Makefile         ->  cgi/bin/*.c Makefile
	config.ini               ->  configuration file 
	daemon_init.c            ->  daemon process 
	doc                      ->  the web page root directory
	log.c                    ->  provide logging 
	main.c                   ->  the main source file
	Makefile                 ->  *.c Makefile
	parse_config.c           ->  read the config.ini 
	parse.h                  ->  the main head file
	parse_option.c           ->  parse the argv 
	README                   ->  it's me 
	secure_access.c          ->  provide easy access control
	webserver.sh             ->  a shell script,to provide start/stop/restart/status the webd
	                             e.g. webserver.sh start/stop/restart/status
	wrap.c                   ->  must functions wrap file  
	wrap.h                   ->  the wrap.c's head file

Bugs:
	If openssl lib library isn't accessible in your computer,you should change the 
	Makefile.For datail,you could see Makefile.
